# Cathedral OS

A personal, long-form operating system project — built slowly, deliberately, and with love over decades.

> "This is not a product. This is a cathedral."

Started: July 2025
Language: C (with Assembly)
Boot method: x86 (BIOS)

The goal is not perfection — but depth, expression, and learning.

## Philosophy

-   Build slowly.
-   Leave traceable thoughts in the code.
-   Embrace asymmetry and imperfection.
-   Let the OS reflect its maker.
