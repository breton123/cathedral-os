# Design Notes

This file will evolve over years. Some sections may contradict others. That's okay.

## Guiding Concepts

-   Every piece of code should feel like part of a living structure.
-   Systems are not born perfect. They evolve.
-   The OS may one day speak, tell stories, or crash poetically.

## Naming Conventions

-   Use poetic or obscure names when meaningful.
-   Let structure emerge over time, not by force.

## First Goals

-   Boot and show a symbol.
-   Write a minimal kernel in C.
-   Build a serial/keyboard driver.
-   Create a simple shell (even if ugly).
